# WISH_CHI_2019_Publication


Throughout highschool I had the opportunity to work at Drexel University's Human Computer Interaction Lab. This was my introduction to Computer Sceience and Human Computer Interaction Research.

In my freshman year of college, I was lucky enough to be a co-author on a paper (https://tinyurl.com/s2xjw5o) published in WISH@CHI 2019 (https://wishworkshop.wordpress.com/accepted-papers/).
